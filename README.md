# Embedded-systems-pedometer-project

Project introduction-

A program that turns the PIC board into a pedometer-clock. The clock is updated in real time and has a selection of views that can be selected by the user:

1. Digital display (On a 12H or 24H basis - according to the user's choice).
2. Analog display.
3. Graphic display.

In addition, the clock functions as a pedometer which picks up and displays the steps performed by the user.

Digital display-

The time display is displayed on a 12-hour basis or a 24-hour basis according to user settings. When the base is 12 hours, am or pm will be displayed depending on the current time. The date display is located in the lower right corner. The motion detection indication (steps detection) will appear by displaying a graphic icon in the upper right corner.

Analog display-

The time display will be done by three graphical hands. Since the base in this case is always 12 hours - am or pm will always be displayed. The date and indication of the steps will be displayed in a similar way to the digital display.

Step graph display- The clock will keep a history of the Steps during the last minute and will display this data graphically in real time.

Motion detection-

When the pedometer senses a step being taken it will display in the upper right corner an animated-icon of steps.

Menus and settings-

The user can make changes to the clock and the pedometer settings using a menu system. Possible actions:

Set display mode -digital, analog or step graph display.
Cycle base for digital display- 12 hours or 24 hours.
